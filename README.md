Analysis and Visualization of my training for the Marine Corps Marathon.

Since late April, I have been training for the Marine Corps Marathon, my first Marathon. I started tracking my weight and running consistently in mid-May and wanted to visualize my progress using key dimensions from my training. I decided to use a recent 20k race as the endpoint for this analysis. At the 20k, I ran a 10:00 pace with the last four miles at a 9:45, 9:30, 9:15, and 8:45 pace, faster than I predicted.

To track my data, I used Apple's workout and Health apps on my Apple Watch.  I was able to export my weight activity without a problem.  However, I had to manually review all my running activity and enter it into a csv to correct and update errors, such as forgetting to start or end a workout or adding workouts from treadmills when I didn't use my watch.

During late May, I pulled my calf muscle and had to limit my running. To ensure I did not lose fitness, I swam on long run days.

To lose wieght, I focused on eating less processed foods, drinking less beer, and eating more lean meats and vegetables.
To build my training plan, I used Hal Higdon's Novice 2 as a baseline.

Six weeks out from Marine Corps Marathon, and I'm on track to complete my training plan! I will be running as part of the Navy-Marine Corps Relief Society team to raise money in support of Sailors and Marines around the world.
