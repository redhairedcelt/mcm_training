Analysis and Visualization of my training for the Marine Corps Marathon.

Since late April, I have been training for the Marine Corps Marathon, my first Marathon. I started tracking my weight and running consistently in mid-May and wanted to visualize my progress using key dimensions from my weeks of training. I decided to use a recent 20k race as the endpoint for this analysis. At the 20k, I ran a 10:00 pace with the last four miles at a 9:45, 9:30, 9:15, and 8:45 pace, faster than I thought.Â¶

During late May, I pulled my calf muscle and had to limit my running. To ensure I did not lose fitness, I swam on long run days.

To lose wieght, I focused on eating less processed foods, drinking less beer, and eating more lean meats and vegetables.

To build my training plan, I used Hal Higdon's Novice 2 as a baseline. (https://www.halhigdon.com/training-programs/half-marathon-training/novice-2-half-marathon/)
